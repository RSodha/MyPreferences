* Default Search should be search all items
* View -> Show as conversations -> Show messages from other folders
* View -> Date(Conversations) -> Show in groups 
* Never delete messages (You can't see in future. You never know what you'll need in future.)
* Using OneNote for meeting minutes did not work well for me. I like using reply emails for notes.
* Using outlook tasks did not work well for me. Instead I used email flags that worked great for me.
* Keep navigation and ToDo Bar always open.
